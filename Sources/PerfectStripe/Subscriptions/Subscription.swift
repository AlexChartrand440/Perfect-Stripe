	///	If the subscription has been canceled, the date of that cancellation. If the subscription was canceled with cancel_at_period_end, canceled_at will still reflect the date of the initial cancellation request, not the end of the subscription period when the subscription is automatically moved to a canceled state.

	///	The quantity of the plan to which the customer should be subscribed. For example, if your plan is $10/user/month, and your customer has 5 users, you could pass 5 as the quantity to have the customer charged $50 (5 x $10) monthly.

	/// Possible values are trialing, active, past_due, canceled, or unpaid. A subscription still in its trial period is trialing and moves to active when the trial period is over. When payment to renew the subscription fails, the subscription becomes past_due. After Stripe has exhausted all payment retry attempts, the subscription ends up with a status of either canceled or unpaid depending on your retry settings. Note that when a subscription has a status of unpaid, no subsequent invoices will be attempted (invoices will be created, but then immediately automatically closed. Additionally, updating customer card details will not lead to Stripe retrying the latest invoice.). After receiving updated card details from a customer, you may choose to reopen and pay their closed invoices.
